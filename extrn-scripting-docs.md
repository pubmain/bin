### Custom Methods

```lua

```

```lua
Instance:Address(): Address
```

## Address

To create an `Address` object u have to call `Address.new(offset: u64)`

NOTE: Address Library must be enabled by the user to be allowed to be used

NOTE: Im talking about creating custom addresses, doing `Instance:Address()`
works fine

```lua
Address:Read(
    offset: u64,
    type: "cstring" | "string" | "f32" | "bool" |
          "u8" | "u16" | "u32" | "u64" | "same for signed ints" |
          "Vector3" | "Vector2"
    )
```

```lua
Address:Write(
    offset: u64,
    type: "f32" | "bool" |
          "u32" | "u64"  |
          "same for signed ints" |
          "Vector3" | "Vector2"
    ),
    value
)
```
